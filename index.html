   &emsp; Distance learning has the potential to be as powerful at successful
instruction as conventional classroom learning. To take advantage of this
potential, planners and educators should apply known principles of perception and learning gleaned from cognitive, behavioral, educational, and
perceptual psychological research. These principles include those of elaborative encoding, interactive learning, reinforcement and the spacing effect.
These principles and their relationship to human learning are presented.
Applications of these principles in conventional distance learning packages
are discussed, including Web page development, course-in-a-box software,
chat rooms, MUD/MOO environments, bulletin boards and real-time online
lectures. Suggestions are provided to guide the course designer in developing
effective instructional tools.<br>
&emsp; Janet, a student in a traditional classroom, is taken on a field trip as part
of her studies of the history of her hometown. She goes on a walking tour of
the downtown area with a guide. They stop to read plaques on important
buildings, and Janet asks questions about some of the strange architecture she
sees. Her guide points out aspects of the geography of the area that affected
the development of the urban area; Janet looks up a street and sees the steep
hill leading to an old church, and notices the smell of sea air in the still-bustling
market center. After the tour, Janet is assigned a project: building a model of
one of the buildings she has seen.<br>
&emsp; David is taking an online course in local history offered by his city’s
community college Website. Each week he connects and reads the latest
chapter of the online text. He looks at online pictures of famous local
    
    buildings. Every six weeks, he takes an online “midterm.” If he passes two
midterms and a final, he will pass the class and earn credits.<br>
&emsp;Most educators would probably agree that Janet’s experience was
“richer.” But while one might suspect that it was also more effective for
learning and retaining information about the subject, it might not be clear
precisely why this is so. In fact, it is likely that her experience would lead to
longer retention and better comprehension of the subject matter. This is not,
however, an inherent disadvantage of distance learning. Rather, it is a
difference in pedagogical approaches. With care, an online course can be
made equally effective—even if not always equally sensually engaging. (It’s
hard to smell the sea through the computer screen!)<br>
&emsp;Instructors are spending increasing amounts of time and energy converting their courses into distance education. They create Web-based classes and
local public broadcasting courses, and make use of packaged courseware,
“drill-and-practice” software, and tools to enhance traditional face-to-face
teaching environments. Students are beginning to embrace the new formats,
but how certain can an instructor be that her students are truly learning the
material? If she runs into one of them a year later, what will he be able to tell
her about the subject matter? Will the student be able to translate and transfer
what he has learned into his life, his work, his understanding of the world?<br>
&emsp;Much of the research into technology education has focused on the
hurdles of attracting and keeping students’ attention, interest and participation. For example, the TLT Group’s respected Flashlight Program (1999;
2000; 2001) focuses on analysis of accessibility, technology barriers, and
tracking use of educational technology installations. An article on “The
effects of electronic classrooms on learning English composition” (Stinson &
Claus, 2000) contains many references to aspects of the class that students
“liked” or “disliked,” and focuses on faculty/course evaluations as a method
of evaluating technology enhancement success or failure. In the 1990s, a
successful educational product was one that kept students involved and
motivated to use it for the largest number of hours and the longest stretch of
weeks. The research and applications focus has been, understandably, on
assessing and improving student participation.<br>
&emsp;As educational technology moves into its next decade, practitioners and
planners are beginning to evaluate whether or not a product successfully
teaches (see, Smith & Warren, 1999), notes Patti Harvey, a consultant quoted
in Geith (1999), “Faculty start to question what is working. We are now
focusing on what learning is, how we describe it, and what that means for
current approaches to how we measure for learning.” Developing successful
distance learning programs is going to require careful attention to, and
    
    incorporation of, successful conventional instructional methods, appropriate
application of conventional and new student assessment methods (such as
testing), and an organized empirical approach. In addition to all that, it will
require a re-examination of what is known about perception, learning,
memory, and the brain, and the incorporation of that knowledge into instructional design.<br>
&emsp;The development of educational curriculum and teaching methodology
is most successful when it is informed by educational research. Educational
research, in turn, is most specific and accurate when informed by psychological research—especially work in the areas of behavioral, perceptual, cognitive and educational psychology. Classroom methods tend to incorporate ad
hoc methods into the mix—things that a particular instructor has found or
believes to be effective. Often, these discoveries are shared in workshops and
books developed for face-to-face instructors, and are subsequently analyzed
in terms of their psychological effectiveness.<br>
&emsp;Such work has not, however, been applied as frequently to educational
technology design. In fact, careful study of many of the educational products
available for developers of distance courseware reveals influences from a
wide range of non-research sources. Such sources include video games, early
Internet communication technologies (that in turn drew on community
communication metaphors, such as the newspaper and public bulletin boards),
and old-fashioned “drill-and-practice” teaching techniques that are no longer
heavily practiced in a modern, live classroom. In addition, developers of
course websites and other courseware unthinkingly may convert bad or
ineffective classroom practices into bad online practices, simply because they
are familiar.<br>
&emsp;As much as there is still to be learned about the human mind and human
learning, what is known provides powerful suggestions about effective
teaching. With the rapid growth of distance learning, it’s timely to look at
some of the most important psychological principles of learning and see how
they might be exploited to create the most effective possible distance learning
environment.
        <center><h3>ELABORATIVE ENCODING</h3></center>
&emsp;The most basic element of learning is probably the storage of information
in long-term memory. From research in cognitive psychology, it is known that
elaborative encoding—using information to be remembered in a creatively
constructed, meaningful way—vastly increases memory for that information
at a later time. The more meaningful the construction, the greater is the
    
    likelihood of retention over the longest period of time (Bradshaw & Anderson, 1982).<br>
&emsp;Most computer-based instruction programs make some attempt to incorporate elaborative encoding into their structure. Some are more successful
than others (and some are successful purely by accident). In many interactive
self-paced training and instructional programs, students are encouraged to
attempt to “fill-in-the-blank” to provide the missing term in a sentence. This
technique is especially popular in some of the early multimedia-rich training
CD-ROMs—an intermediate step between the traditional classroom and
online instruction. In many of these, the student either is asked to “guess” what
might be coming next in the lecture (that is, the needed information cannot be
derived from the preceding text), or to regurgitate something, in a prescribed
form, that has recently been presented. This is not the most effective
elaboration; it is fairly shallow processing and may not lead to lasting
memory.<br>
&emsp;Yet this type of exercise is still very popular in corporate and professional
computer-based training. It is even found in academic environments, especially in the context of staff development training.<br>
 &emsp;“Course-in-a-box” software packages provide a simple way for faculty
or teaching assistants to construct a course website without programming
knowledge. These applications can be used from anywhere on the Internet,
rather than past modes of needing software in a particular lab or relying on
CD-ROM-based instructional aids. Tools such as a bulletin board or chat
room can be added with a “point and click.” Other commonly included tools
are password protection, grade posting, image databases, and glossary tools.
Administrative departments such as health and safety are often anxious to
leverage such institutional instructional technology investments to reduce
personnel costs for training. Rather than using the packages in a meaningful
way, however, they convert old “fill-in-the-blank” quizzes to an online
format, and remove some of the valuable aspects of classroom instruction
(such as interaction with instructors) without looking for online replacements.<br>
&emsp;But many “course-in-a-box” applications, such as WebCT, offer an
excellent opportunity for elaborative encoding: they have the capability to
permit the student to develop his or her own Web page. If the student creates
a website to present to others some aspect of the material that she has studied,
learning can be enhanced. The process of reorganizing information in order
to teach others is intensely elaborative.<br>
&emsp;This facility is extremely valuable—more so than less structured offerings such as chat rooms. Conventional classroom teachers have realized for
    
    
    years that creative constructions using course material are incredibly effective. Like a book report, a science fair project, and the seminar-style class
(typical of graduate studies, where each student in turn presents new material
to his fellow students), the creation of a website gives the student an
opportunity to meaningfully encode the material he has been taught<br>.
&emsp;At Mount Union College in Alliance, Ohio, Jim Phillips takes the
elaborative online assignment one step further. He asks students in his
instructional design courses to develop full-blown online tutorials that
instruct others on a topic they are studying. This causes the students not only
to use learned material in an elaborative way, but to examine in depth their
logic and grasp of the subject by asking and anticipating questions from their
own audience (J. Phillips, personal interview with C. Bagwell, 2000).<br>
&emsp;MUD/MOO text-based virtual environments are becoming increasingly
popular in educational applications. MUDs are modeled after 1970s textbased computer adventure games such as Adventure and Zork. They place the
user in a virtual world, where he can navigate from room-to-room and interact
with objects found there using plain English-style commands. MUDs, however, provide access to multiple users at the same time, and permit users to
interact with each other in the virtual environment (for example, users in the
same virtual “pub” may chat, order beers for each other, and look around at
an identical text-based scene). MUDs also have features that, more than
simple chat rooms, allow the creative educator to develop ideal environments
for elaborative encoding. There are several aspects of MUDs/MOOs that
enable elaboration:<br>
•&emsp; context–rich conversational environments<br>
• &emsp;the ability to develop relevant yet appealing educational “adventures” or<br>
&emsp;“quests,” where students must use both their knowledge of the subject<br>
&emsp;matter and their reasoning and problem-solving skills to work their way<br>
&emsp;through a process. (MUD “quests” resemble interactive experiencebased problem-solving/teaching games such as the Learning<br> &emsp;Company’s<br>
&emsp;Carmen Sandiego (2001).)<br>
• &emsp;“‘Bots” (programs that interact with students as if they were simply<br>
&emsp;another participant). These can be programmed to converse with the<br>
&emsp;student on the topic of interest, to provide feedback and reinforcement<br>
&emsp;for discussion of relevant subject matter, and to offer hints, more<br>
&emsp;advanced information, and explanations in response to creatively phrased<br>
&emsp;questions from the student.<br>
&emsp;Mike O’Brien of the Aerospace Corporation used MUD technology to
create an Egyptology quest, known as TinyLondon. The quest provides
participants with an exciting and mentally challenging text-based adventure
    
    game—and, in the process, teaches them several aspects of the Middle
Egyptian language.<br>
&emsp;The adventurer wanders through the Nile Valley, collecting scraps of
parchment ostensibly written by Herodotus, the Greek historian. For example, you see a bit of vellum on the ground and look at it:
   <br><br> 
    </p>
    
    
    <p class="p1">
        <b> look vellum</b><br>
“For whatever reason, these Ancients appeared never to
vary their verbs, as we do, so that commands and statements
sounded alike in their ears, and past, present and future
were but ill-distinguished. Thus, J3I, to cross a stream
or river, has no other forms or conjugation.”
    
    </p>
    &emsp;Later, you sit at the bank of the Nile, which you’d like to cross. You see
a boat:
    <p class="p1">
    
        <b>look boat</b><br>
There is a boat here, with no one in it. It is made out
of woven papyrus reeds, and bobs gently against the bank
of the river.<br>
        <b>Get into boat</b><br>
You climb into a rickety-looking, shaky boat made out of
papyrus reeds.
In a Boat(#9538R)
The boat is sound, though seemingly fragile. It does not
move, but you sense that it could take you where you wish
if you expressed yourself properly.<br>
    </p><br>
    You might try a few English commands with no effect:
    <p class="p1">
    
    
        <b>cross</b><br>
Huh? (Type “help” for help.)<br>
        <b>Go across</b><br>
* You can’t go that way.<br>
        <b>Take me across</b><br>
* I don’t see that here.<br> 
    </p>
    &emsp;Finally, you remember that scrap of vellum you read about Middle
Egyptian verbs, and its casual reference to crossing streams. You say:
J3I<br>
        
    <p class="p1">
    
    The boat hears your command, and you are whisked quickly
and silently across the breadth of the Nile.
</p>

    <center> (M. O’Brien, personal interview with V. Polichar, September, 1999).</center><br>
    
    &emsp;A great deal of potential exists in the use of MUDs/MOOs for education.
One early adopter of this technology is Reed Riner, a professor of anthropology at Northern Arizona University (NAU) who for many years in the early
    
    1990s taught a class in futures anthropology using a MUD (Riner & Clodius,
1995). Remote participants included not only the students at NAU, but also
sister classes at the University of Dayton (under John Bregenzer) and other
schools and advisors scattered around the U.S. and Canada.<br><br>
    <center><h3>ONLINE INTERACTIVE DISCUSSION</h3></center>
&emsp;Work by Frase and Schwartz (1975) indicates that having students work
together, taking turns asking and answering questions about course material,
improves subsequent test performance. A bulletin or discussion board offers
an excellent structured environment for such discourse, and can be an
effective learning tool for online courses. As opposed to a chat room or a
MUD/MOO, a discussion board offers students an asynchronous forum for
communication. A discussion board gives students as much time as needed
to formulate their thoughts and questions. It forgives slow typing, and
provides a forum for the shy and for those less adept with English. (The
inherent time delay between question and answer in this environment may
also be beneficial, if students go on studying other material in the interim; this
useful effect will be discussed later in the chapter.)<br>
&emsp;Chat rooms are a popular enhancement to online courses, but have the
potential to be a dead end for learning. Students may chat about anything and
everything—and not necessarily course material. (At the authors’ home
university, chat rooms have become known as “Hey, babe!” rooms.) Worse,
chat rooms may lead to both elaboration and reinforcement of mistakes and
incorrect understandings of course material.<br>
&emsp;For faculty who want students to interact, but who want control over
where the discussion leads, discussion board systems (such as DISCUS,
WebBoard or facilities in Blackboard’s CourseInfo or WebCT) are preferable. Message-queuing features offer moderators the option to post or reject
messages, so that faculty or TAs can ensure that messages are on target,
concepts are being explained accurately, and facts being shared are correct.
The interactive quality of these systems makes them nearly as appealing to
students as chat rooms, but usually more pedagogically appropriate. (Alternatively, in a MUD or MOO environment, TAs, faculty, or even “Bots” can
remain present in real-time to guide the discussion or answer questions.)<br>
&emsp;Chat rooms can be useful if tightly controlled. Teaching assistants at the
University of California-San Diego, use them to provide virtual office hours
prior to exams. A 9–11 p.m. on-campus study session is often impractical for
working and married students. However, offered online, virtual office hours
provide students with an opportunity to have critical questions answered in
the comfort of their own homes.
    
    
    
  &emsp;  Some programs, such as WebCT, allow for review of the chat room logs.
Care must be taken, however, not to violate local privacy policies, especially
in the university environment. It may also foster an atmosphere of distrust that
could lead to decreased use of the environment. Finally, when an instructor
corrects a student’s misconception based on a log, the correction is received
long after the concept has been voiced, and encoded, by the student. It is
entirely likely that the misunderstanding will be what is remembered, unless
the instructor requires an elaborative task to be performed along with the
receipt of the correction.<br>
&emsp;Other skills are learned in the educational process besides the specific
topic at hand. Carol B. MacKnight points out that students “need coaching and
practice in how to carry on online discussions. Initially, faculty must step in
and support disciplined discussions… in monitoring discussions or group
work activity, faculty must engage in a line of questioning that will continue
to drive an idea, thus helping students develop and apply critical thinking
skills.” These “critical skills” are important for elaborative encoding, and
hence for learning (MacKnight, 2000). Theodore Groves, of the University of
California-San Diego, would agree. He found it initially challenging to accept
student questions via electronic mail without returning the exact answer
immediately. Ideally, in a face-to-face office hours situation, an instructor
would not simply give out an answer but instead guide students into arriving
at solutions themselves by giving hints, supplying leading information and
asking the students questions. It takes extra attention to apply this technique
in an asynchronous medium, be it electronic mail or a bulletin board, but it is
necessary to take full advantage of the value introduced by the technology (T.
Groves, personal conversation with C. Bagwell, 2000; Knowlton, Knowlton
& Davis, 2000). Effective use of teaching technology will help the student “go
beyond being exposed to content to the point of critically interacting with it”
(MacKnight, 2000).
    <center><h3>REINFORCEMENT</h3></center>
&emsp;Reinforcers help to increase the likelihood that a given behavior will
happen again (Thorndike, 1898). More colloquially, rewarding a person’s
action makes the person likely to repeat that action. Many educational
software developers have incorporated this notion into their programs. For
example, in an addition drill program for children, successful completion of
the presented math problem might result in a song being played.<br>
&emsp;There are several challenges in using reinforcement to enhance learning,
but one of the most compelling is that it is not always effective. The very first
The Challenge of Teaching Effecti
    
    
    question you must ask when seeking to incorporate reinforcement into your
courseware is what is a reinforcer for my audience? (A secondary, but also
important question, is what is a punisher for my audience?) Only with this
information can you create courseware that does not skirt its intended
purpose, or, worse, frustrate the user to the point where they cease to use it.<br>
&emsp;For many students, especially children and young adults, simply working
with a computer is a reinforcer. Doing anything on a computer may be more
appealing than participating in class activities, sitting in a large crowd, or even
driving to campus. In fact, the experience of searching for a parking place on
a crowded college campus may act as a punishment for driving to school! This
effect will drive many students to choose a distance learning option, whether
or not it is effective, and whether or not they use the courseware in the manner
the instructor intended.<br>
&emsp;It’s important for course designers to be aware of this inherent reinforcement effect for two reasons. First, developers must be certain that any
reinforcer in the program is both dependent upon desired behavior, and more
powerful than the other pleasures of interacting with the machine or program,
or it will not increase learning. This is true whether the reinforcer is one they
have deliberately inserted, or one that unexpectedly emerges during testing.<br>
&emsp;Sharon Polichar, a San Diego elementary-level English as a Second
Language (ESL) educator, has used Davidson & Associates’ Falling Fruit
software to help her students learn punctuation. An unpunctuated sentence
appears on the screen; students are asked to position a colorful toucan under
the piece of falling fruit that contains the appropriate punctuation mark. If the
punctuation is correct, the toucan gets to eat the fruit. If it is incorrect, the fruit
explodes onto the toucan’s head.<br>
&emsp;Polichar found that, instead of attempting to select the right answer,
students were moving the toucan at random. The sight of the toucan getting
whacked on the head with exploding fruit was much more entertaining than
the sight of him eating! The most powerful reinforcer in the program was one
the designers had clearly intended as a punisher. The planned reinforcer had
little or no effect (S. Polichar, personal conversation with V. Polichar, 2000).<br>
&emsp;In addition to ensuring that reinforcement is appropriately affecting
behavior, it’s important to remember that simply getting to use a computer for
a class is not a reinforcer for all students. It is critical for computer-based
instruction to be compelling, or some students will cease to participate.<br>
&emsp;One generally effective reinforcer for self-paced online or disk-based
courses is the inclusion of frequent, short quizzes with the score displayed
prominently (along with a message such as, “Congratulations, you scored
82%! You have passed this chapter!”). The frequency and brevity help ensure
    
    
    that the student will succeed; their placement at the end of a section of study
ensures that the student has worked through the chapter. These quizzes should
not be confused with actual tests that measure learning. Most students will
complete the test using short- and medium-term memory. However, the
process of taking the quiz may assist in elaborative encoding, and the notice
of passing the quiz provides reinforcement to study and to elaborative work.
Moreover, Graham (1999) has found that administering pop quizzes significantly enhanced scores on subsequent exams and increased student motivation to study.<br>
&emsp;Many courseware programs offer quizzes. In most cases, however, they
can be taken at any time, whether or not a chapter has just been completed, and
taking the quizzes is not inherently part of completing a chapter. This
decoupling somewhat lessens the positive effect that might otherwise be
obtained. In the worst cases, as in some web-based “driver education” classes
that are offered for U.S. drivers who have received speeding tickets, students
have the ability to complete all the quizzes without even clicking through the
pages containing the training information.<br>
&emsp;Reinforcement in the computer-based segment of a course can enhance
the face-to-face segment as well. David Perlmutter at the University of
California-San Diego uses spaced quizzes to encourage in-class participation
and attendance, and to compel students to keep up with the reading. He
requires students in his “Sign Language and Culture” courses to take a weekly
online pass/fail quiz. He decided to add this online supplement because of a
copying delay. On the day of a scheduled midterm, the exam was not ready
to be distributed. When he announced his intention to give a lecture in
place of the exam, half the class got up and left the room. By ambitiously
and successfully implementing the online weekly quizzes, which are
graded automatically, he has effectively provided motivation for lecture
attendance. The automated nature of this tool permits him to provide this
motivation for over 250 students (D. Perlmutter, personal conversation
with C. Bagwell, 1999).<br>
&emsp;Reinforcers can be powerful learning tools when training any skill, such
as playing basketball, knitting, or soldering. The principles of operant
conditioning teach us that progressively reinforcing closer and closer approximations to a desired physical task, or “shaping,” will effectively train a
subject to perform a task with great accuracy.<br>
&emsp;It’s less clear how reinforcement is useful in learning conceptual materials, such as understanding the political motivations behind a historical
event. While one can reinforce correct answers to test questions, this has
the effect of improving test scores. It is not necessarily clear that it will
improve understanding.
    
    
   &emsp; However, reinforcers can be extremely useful in keeping students on
task, especially reluctant ones. Faculty who anticipate difficulty in getting
students involved in online participation can circumvent the problem by
offering incentives to students who post and respond to questions. Incentives
might include class participation grade points or public “Good job!” messages. Stanley Chodorow, at the University of California-San Diego, assigns
his Humanities students points based on their participation on the class
message board (S. Chodorow, personal conversation with C. Bagwell, 2000).<br><br>
    <center><h3>THE “SPACING EFFECT”</h3></center>
 &emsp; A final important psychological principle is the spacing effect. When an
item to be committed to memory is studied for a while, put away for a longer
period (which can be weeks or even months), and then taken out and restudied,
later recall for the item is more effective than if the same total study time is
spent in one session (Reder & Anderson, 1982; Greene, 1989). Self-paced
learning naturally exploits this phenomenon, but it can be enhanced by careful
course structure.<br>
 &emsp; Interspersing topics is a useful technique. It creates natural breaks
between periods of study of a given topic; also, it has been found that
information retrieval is strengthened when information to be learned is related
to information already stored (Singh et al., 1994). Deft interrelating of
different topics, as well as course segments that build on segments that come
before, can enhance this effect.<br>
 &emsp; Increasing specialization of training has made it tempting to create
single-subject or sub-subject course segments that can “stand alone.” The
practical value of such a segmented course to the student is partially offset by
the fact that topics are no longer interrelated or built on each other. To take
advantage of the Singh effect, courses need not be entirely incremental. Students
can be asked to apply knowledge and techniques learned in one segment as they
approach a second topic. Alternatively, the students themselves may be asked to
create the relationship in their creative efforts (e.g., “Develop a Web page that
shows how you might apply these principles of long-term memory storage to what
you learned in the last chapter about visual perception”).<br>
 &emsp; Finally, self-paced may not be the best pace. It’s possible to avoid this
problem by scheduling some real-time events (such as an online guest speaker
in the MUD/MOO or chat room, or an upcoming television documentary to
be watched when it airs) and activities (such as a creative project, a trip to a
local museum, or an exploration of a community resource) into a course.
Introduction of time structure into a distance course has two positive effects.
    <br>
    First, it helps keep the student working at a realistic pace. “Cramming” is
notoriously ineffective at true instruction (Fulkerson & Martin, 1981;
Brethrower, 1982), and a self-paced class makes this practice more likely if
some structure is not also present. Secondly, it creates an opportunity to take
advantage of the spacing effect to improve overall learning.
    <center><h3>NEW AREAS FOR RESEARCH</h3></center>
 &emsp;The isolation effect, generally attributed to von Restorff (1933), demonstrates that memory for a unique type of item in a list of otherwise similar items
will be enhanced. This discovery has spawned a great deal of research into the
possible mechanisms for this enhancing effect, but the effect itself is potentially useful in instructional design.<br>
 &emsp;More research is needed in this area, but the possible applications are
interesting. For example, one way of making sure students get the critical
point of a discussion might be to embed it in a presentation of a different type
of information. If the date of one particular Civil War battle is critical to
understanding a political decision process, a list of locations of Civil War
battles might be presented, with a date appearing by only one. A discussion
of export products of Australia might include a note about the geology of the
country, since that country’s unique geology is a driver of many of these
products. Even if the student can’t remember the list of battles or the list of
products, they might recall that a critical battle took place before a particular
presidential decision, or might be able to reconstruct the exports by remembering the great mineral resources of an ancient, flat continent.<br>
 &emsp;It is well known that short-term memory can only hold 7±2 “chunks” of
information at one time, and information must remain in short-term memory
long enough to be encoded if it is to be transferred to long-term memory.
Given this, dense, information-packed hour-plus lectures make it difficult for
most students to absorb much of the material at the time of presentation. The
typical college student takes copious notes, doesn’t try to digest any of the
material at the time of presentation, and depends on later processing and
interpretation—but often notes are not sufficient for complete understanding.
Older-style distance learning, where students watched lectures on television
in series, compounded the problem, as it was not possible to ask the instructor
even to pause for a question. New technology can help avert this problem for
distance learners.<br>
 &emsp;Streamed audio and video presentations are becoming very popular as
information delivery methods. Stanley Chodorow used to bring in slide
carousels for his traditional-classroom lower division Humanities courses.
    <br>
    
    Now, using Real Presenter, Microsoft PowerPoint and a Real streaming
server, he records his voice coordinated with the slideshow, creating an online
presentation. In addition to making these presentations available to students
for on-demand and multiple viewings, this method permits Chodorow to
break up his lectures into five- to ten-minute segments. Such a segment is
much more digestible to students than an hour-long lecture, permitting
information to remain in their short-term memory long enough to be encoded and
stored. Studying in segments of this sort also permits students to take advantage
of the spacing effect. And students like the new format. Though the presentations
are not interactive, a surprising side effect was that many students felt they were,
in the sense that it felt as if the professor was speaking directly to the individual
student (S. Chodorow, personal interview with C. Bagwell, 2000).<br>
&emsp;Finally, a new effort in research should be directed at measuring, as much
as possible in the real online instructional environment, the real effects on
learning and memory of the above-mentioned techniques. Without this
validation, extrapolation from psychological findings will quickly fall into
the same “pop psychology” realm that drives so much traditional classroom
development. The first step is to make the link between psychological
research and effective learning. The second is to find ways to realize these
connections to make distance learning more effective. The third is to evaluate
the effectiveness of implementations and to make appropriate changes. As
more continues to be discovered about the brain and how humans learn,
distance learning can be refined to be as effective as—perhaps even more
effective than—traditional classroom instruction.<br>
&emsp;Claire is a student in a new distance learning class on local history. Each
week, she spends some time interacting with her fellow students in an online
MUD that represents her hometown as it was 100 years ago. Her special
assignment for the semester is to work with her fellow students to develop a
method of delivering water to new residents, whose homes are progressively
further away from the river. To improve her ability to negotiate online with
other students responsible for the metal works, labor animals, land rights and
other relevant areas, she is given suggestions on places to visit in real life. She
stops by the town waterworks and talks to the foreman, who has been there for
many years. At the library, she finds photographs and plans of the first
municipal sewer system. Online at the town’s utilities company Web page,
she watches an animation of city water delivery and learns about capacities
and costs of the system.<br>
&emsp;In addition to her personal project, Claire is learning about local political,
architectural, economical and agricultural history. She watches streaming
video and public broadcasting specials. She reads short texts and responds to
    
    questions at the end of them, receiving instant feedback to confirm that her
understanding is correct. She connects to an online chat room during office
hours and talks to her instructor. She takes part in group discussions on the
MUD, takes exams online, and even submits her final “paper”—a multimedia
presentation analyzing her successes and failures in the virtual MUD environment—via electronic mail.<br>
&emsp;A year in the future, who do you think will be able to answer your
questions about their own town’s history, David, Janet or Claire?<br>
&emsp;Strategic application of what is known about how humans learn to the
distance learning environment can produce instruction that is as effective as,
or even more effective than, traditional classroom teaching. Encouragement
of student processes that cause elaborative encoding to occur, careful use of
reinforcers and targeted interrelation of topics and time intervals to take
advantage of the spacing effect, combined with appropriate use of interactive
online discussion, will add power to courseware. Further research will help
identify additional psychological factors that can be used to strengthen
distance learning, and will help establish these effects empirically.
